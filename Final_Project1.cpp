//Recipe Project
//By: Daylon Bingham
//Purpose:
//To recomend recipies acording to the user's situation

//The program works and I have included some default recipies in order to demonstrate
//the programs functionality. However, if it is to fully serve its purpose, it will
//need more actual recipies.


#include <iostream>
#include "functions.h"
#include "SecondaryFunctions.h"
#include "recipeClass.h"

using namespace std;

//This is the default user information.
string userInfo[6] = {"Usern", "Passw", "2", "crockpot,microwave,oven,pan,toaster", "3", "egg,hotdog,hamburger,ham,bun,apple,potato"};
//eperience, equipment, ingredient divercity, ingredients


//Used as a jumping off point
